        Before opening an issue, please search for all open and closed Github issues as well as any
        relevant discussion topics that may match your situation.
        
        Please **DO NOT** open bugs for simple howto usage questions or basic operational issues such
        as "I can't get the live stream to work". Such issues should be directed to the [discussion groups](https://github.com/tsightler/ring-mqtt/discussions) 
        instead.
        
        Please **DO NOT** open bugs if you are not prepared to provide logs or answer questions in a
        timely manner (at least every few days).  Issues that receive no followup responses will be
        subject to closure after 72 hours.
        
        Please include the information requested in the fields below completely or the issue will
        likely be closed immediately.
        
        **Important note regarding camera support**    
        The ring-mqtt project does not turn Ring cameras into 24x7 CCTV cameras capable of continous
        streaming.  Ring cameras are designed to work with Ring cloud servers for on-demand streaming
        based on detected events (motion/ding) or for on-demand interactive viewing.  Even when using
        ring-mqtt, all streaming still goes through Ring cloud servers and is not local.  Using this
        project for continuous streaming is not a supported use case and attempts to do so will almost
        certainly end in disappointment.  Any support cases opened for issues with continuous streaming
         (i.e. more than one streaming session back-to-back) will be closed as unsupported.  This
         includes use with NVR tools like Frigate or motionEye.
