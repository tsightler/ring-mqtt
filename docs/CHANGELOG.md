## v5.6.7
This release is intended to address an ongoing instability with websocket connections by using a newer API endpoint for requesting tickets.

**Other Changes**
- Updated to go2rtc v1.9.4 wich includes support for custom kill signal for exec which will hopefully address long term issues with occassional "hung" streams that require plugin restart to re-active.

**Dependency Updates**
- ring-client-api v12.1.1
- go2rtc v1.9.4

## v5.6.6
This release reverts go2rtc to v1.9.2 to address streaming stability issues caused by exec handling changes that were implemented in go2rtc v1.9.3.

**Dependency Updates**
- aedes v0.51.2
- debug v4.3.5

## v5.6.5
This release is intended to address the current brokenness of HA 2024.6.x by forcing the alarm control panel entity discovery to set code_arm_required = false even when no code is configured.  While I believe this should be fixed in upstream HA, I have no influence over if/when that will happen and this workaround should have no negative impact on older versions.

**Dependency Updates**
- go2rtc v1.9.3
- mqtt v5.7.0
- werift v0.19.3

## v5.6.4
**Minor Enhancements**
- New attributes alarmClearedBy/alarmClearedTime are updated when alarm is in triggered state and is cleared via the keypad or app.
- Some entities now have categories assigned so that they appear in Configuration and Diagnostic categories in the Home Assistant UI.  This also means that these entities will not be automatically included in generated views, for example, when exporting devices from Home Assitant to another platform like HomeKit, although you can still manually choose to export those entities if desired. Thanks to @xannor for initial PR for this feature.

**Bugs fixed**
- Fixed an issue where the alarm state would lose syncronization if alarm was disarmed but a fire/co alarm was triggered and then cleared.  Thanks to @iptvcld for reporting this issue and providng the details required to reproduce.

**Dependcy Updates**
- Alpine Linux 3.18 (Docker image)
- go2rtc v1.8.5
- ring-client-api v12.1.0
- werift v0.19.1
- aedes v0.51.0
- mqtt v5.5.2
- express v4.19.2
- s6-overlay v3.1.6.2
- bashio v0.16.2

## v5.6.3
**Minor Enhancements**
- lastArmBy/lastDisarmBy now reports correct names for guest users as well as shared users
- Locks now support "LOCKING" and "UNLOCKING" status which provides for a richer experience in the Home Assistant UI
- HVAC enhanced to use new "supported_features" capability in Home Assistant >2023.9.  This allows ring-mqtt to inform Home Assistant which arming modes are supported thus suppressing unavailable arming modes from being visible in the Home Assistant user interface.

**Other Changes**
- Remove auxillary heat implementaion which was deprecated in Home Assistant 2023.9.  Auxillary/emergency heat is still available but is now exposed as a preset mode instead (behavior is duplicated from the Z-wave thermostat implementation).
- Suppress hass warnings from go2rtc (cosmetic only)

**Dependcy Updates**
- go2rtc v1.7.1
- ring-client-api v12.0.1

## v5.6.2
**Bugs Fixed**
- Fix crash when discovering Ring Bridge due to missing operator

## v5.6.1
**New Features**
- Add support for configuring chirp tones for Ring binary sensors
- Return support for Ring Bridge which was temporarily removed in v5.6.0 due to phantom devices for some users
- Snapshot camera attributes now include the snapshot type of the current snapshot in addition to the previous timestamp attribute.  Snapshot types can be any of "motion", "ding", "interval" or "on-demand".  This can assist with automation cases where a specific snapshot type is preffered.  However, note that no snapshot is ever guarateed and it can sometimes take multiple seconds to request and return a snapshot so, as an example, if the automation is triggered by motion, but then waits for a motion snapshot, a timeout should also be included to keep the automation from waiting forever if for some reason the snapshot could not be retrieved.

**Dependcy Updates**
- go2rtc v1.7.0

## v5.6.0
**New Features**
- Cameras now include a button entity to request an on-demand snapshot.  This was a much requested feature and is intended primarily to allow snapshots to be triggered from automations (in Home Assistant this can be doen via the button press service).  Note that on-demand snapshots are limited to no more than one request every 10 seconds, more frequent requests will be logged, but otherwise ignored.  Also, low-power Ring cameras are unable to take snapshots while recording so there is no guarantee that a request for a snapshot on these cameras will be possible.
- For doorbells it's now possible to get snapshots from ding events in addition to motion events and new snapshot modes have been introduced to select which combination of ding, motion, and interval snapshots are desired.  Ding snapshots are enabled by default for both Auto and All modes, but note that battery cameras will likely require a Ring subscription to get reliable snapshots from dings, just like motion.
- Add support to enable/disable chirps on Ring keypads

**Other Changes**
- Adapt MQTT discovery messages to new entity naming guidelines introduced in Home Assistant 2023.8
- Minor tweak for tamper sensor to increase compatibility with OpenHAB (thanks to @zolakk for the PR)
- Merge and simplify WebRTC connection code and include recent minor updates for better reliability
- Try to capture and log null responses during web token generation

**Dependcy Updates**
- ring-client-api v12.0.0
- aedes v0.50.0
- werift 0.18.5


## v5.5.1
**New Features**
- Improved support for HEVC mode cameras\
  While the initial support for HEVC required local transcoding, this update uses a different streaming API that is able to negotiates down to H.264/AVC for these cameras on-the-fly which means HEVC enabled cameras should now work fine even on lower-performance hardware like RPi3/4 devices.  Hopefully this new API does not break streaming for other cases.

**Other Changes**
- Use a non-cached snapshot for all cases
- Implement multiple retries if initial request for snapshot update fails

**Dependency Updates**
- go2rtc v1.6.2

## v5.5.0
**New Features**
- Initial support for HEVC mode cameras\
  Ring is actively enabling the H.265/HEVC codec on some newer camera models and the Ring Andriod-app based API used by ring-mqtt actively rejects any other protocol for these cameras.  The Ring web based dashboard uses a different API which appears to support negotiating H.264/AVC with these devices as a fallback but, so far, I haven't been able to get it to work correctly with ring-mqtt, hopefully that will be resolved eventually.

  Passing HEVC through unchanged presents too many compatibility issues with downstream devices to be practical so, for now, ring-mqtt will attempt to transcode these streams back to H.264/AVC on-the-fly.  This provides wide compatibiltiy with downstream devices, but at the cost of significantly increased CPU usage during streaming.

  Ideally, over time, more browsers will add H.265/HEVC support to their WebRTC implementations so passthrough will become a viable option, but, for now, transcoding provides a quick and dirty hack that will at least allow these cameras work in many cases.  Note that if you are running on a RPi3 this will probably not work, and an RPi4 will barely be able to support a single stream.
- Add switch to toggle motion warning for cameras that support this feature
- Implement new logic for entry/exit delay (inspired by @amura11):
  - Exit delay now supports both home and away modes
  - Depends on actual events from Ring API vs previous blind wait function
  - Alarm attributes now include "exitSecondsLeft" and "entrySecondsLeft" which will count down during entry/exit delay.
  - Alarm attributes now include "targetMode" so it's possible to know what mode alarm is attempting to enter even while exit delay is in progress.  For entry delay this attribute makes it possoble to know what mode the alarm was in when the entry delay was triggered.  This allows creating different automations for entry/exit delays based on the home and away arming modes.

**Bugs Fixed**
- Fix an issue detecting subscriptions and suppress spurrious error messages from cameras in case of accounts with no paid subscription.
- Request non-cached snapshots for motion events on high-powered cameras even if no UUID is available (e.g. no subscription).
- Make stream source and still image URL attributes work even if calls to heath check API fail.

**Dependency Updates**
- go2rtc v1.6.0
- werift v0.18.4

## v5.4.1
**Bugs Fixed**
- Fix alarm state not updating for various conditions (armed/disarmed with keypad, exit-delay, etc)

## v5.4.0
This release is mostly to get back to stable ring-client-api version with final fixes for camera notification issues, however, managed to sneak in one highly requested feature and a few minor improvements as well.

**New Features**
- Alarm control panel now includes lastArmedBy/lastDisarmedBy attributes making it possible to determine who/what triggered an arm/disarm event.

**Other Changes**
- Device Name/System ID is now displayed in the Web UI and CLI authentication tools providing easier identification of the corresponding device in the Authorized Devices section of the Ring Control Center.
- Camera event management has been completely reworked using a new event management API.  Primary goal was to avoid API throttling issues that could occur with large numbers of cameras (>50% reduction in API calls, even more during startup).

**Bugs Fixed**
- Fixed an issue where motion snapshots might return an cached snapshot instead
- Fixed an issue with panic switches where a burglar alarm could trigger both police and fire panic states.

**Dependency Updates**
- ring-client-api v11.8.0
- bashio v0.15.0

## v5.3.0
The primary goal of this update is to address issues with camera/doorbell/intercom notifications that have impacted many users due to changes in the Ring API for push notifications.  This version uses a new upstream ring-client-api that persist the FCM token and hardware ID across restarts which will hopefully address these issues, however, it's important to note that addressing this will likely require users to re-authenticate following the instructions below:

**Steps to fix notifications**
If you have cameras/doorbells/intercoms and are not receiving notifications you will need to follow these steps to re-establish authentication with the Ring API:

1. Stop the addon and verify that it is no longer running
2. In the official Ring App or using the Ring web based dashboard go to the Control Center
3. Click on Authorized Client Devices
4. In the list of authorized devices find and remove all devices associated with ring-mqtt, these devices will have names like the following:
   - ring-mqtt
   - ring-mqtt-addon
   - Device name not found
   - Unknown device
5. Once you have removed all of these devices restart the addon.
6. Review the addon logs and it should show that the existing token is invalid and you need to use the web UI to create a new one
7. Use the addon web UI to authenticate with Ring and re-establish the connection with the Ring API
8. Notifications should now be working!

**New Features**
- Added support to enable/disable motion detection for cameras

**Fixed Bugs**
- Use persistent FCM tokens so that push notifications survive restarts
- Remove doubled-up devices in Ring Control Center, including one "unknown device" when authenticating
- Fix random crash of go2rtc process which impacted some users (fixed by bumping go2rtc to v1.5.0)

**Dependency Updates**
- ring-client-api v11.8.0-beta.0
- werift v0.18.3
- rxjs v7.8.1
- go2rtc v1.5.0
- s6-overlay v3.1.5.0

## v5.2.2
**Fixed Bugs**
- Update ring-client-api to v11.7.5 which should fix issues with web token generation caused by changes in Ring API.

## v5.2.1
**Fixed Bugs**
- Update ring-client-api to v11.7.4 which should fix an issue with motion snapshots not working due to a change in push notification data sent by the Ring API.
- Suppress spurious "Lost subscription to ding" messages in log which led to confusion for users.

**Other Changes**
- Tamper sensors now use "tamper" device class in Home Assistant vs the generic "problem" device class used previously.

**Dependency Updates**
- Bump go2rtc to v1.3.1

## v5.2.0
**New Features**
- Basic support for Ring Intercom, the following features are supported:
  - Ding state - Simple binary sensor, stays "on" for 20 seconds after ding
  - Lock state - Unlock command is supported and also triggers on unlock from Ring app.  Stays in unlocked state for 5 seconds before reverting to locked state.
  - Battery status
  - Wifi status
- Keypad proximity sensor is now exposed as a motion sensor (only tested with Keypad Gen2 model)
- Implement improved Home Assistant behavior for MQTT thermostats when switching between auto and heat/cool modes.  Requires Home Assistant 2023.3 release or later, but provides much improved behavior which should mirror that of thermostats connected directly via Z-wave.
- Based on requests, camera motion and ding event "on" duration can now be configured on a per-device basis.  For now, the default duration remains 180 seconds, which is based on the ding expire time property sent as part of the ding event in the Ring API and also aligned with first-generation motion sensors which would stay in "on" state for 180 seconds after any detected motion.  However, many users have requested a shorter "on" duration and second-generation motion sensors now use 20 seconds, so this new feature provides flexibility for those users.  Based on feedback, future versions may use the shorter "on" duration by default.

**Fixed Bugs**
- Fixed an issue with generic binary sensors which caused them to fail automatic discovery in Home Assistant.

**Dependency Updates**
- Bump go2rtc to v1.2.0
- Bump werift to v0.18.2 with some WebRTC stun negotiation improvements.  May fix livestream failures for users with more complex network setups.
- Bump ring-client-api to v11.7.2
- Bump s6-overlay to v3.1.4.1

## v5.1.3
**Fixed Bugs**
- Don't crash on codec mismatch.  This is caused by the fact that Ring has started rolling out support for the HEVC/H.265 video encoding format on some devices and cameras, however, this format still has many issues and incompatibilities in downstream browsers and devices.  For now the suggestion for ring-mqtt users is to enable [Legacy Video Mode](https://support.ring.com/hc/en-us/articles/4417503172116-Legacy-Video-Mode-) for any cameras that are using this codec as default.

**Other Changes**
- Include RTX as part of WebRTC codec negotiation which can improve robustness and reduce artifacting of the livestream in cases where there is minor UDP packet loss.
- Disable WebRTC port on internal go2rtc instance.

**Dependency Updates**
- Bump go2rtc version to v1.1.2
- Bump s6-overlay to v3.1.3.0

## v5.1.2 (re-publish of v5.1.1)
**Fixed Bugs**
- Fix crash on Chime Pro (1st Generation) models

## v5.1.0
After several releases focused on stability and minor bug fixes this release includes significant internal changes and a few new features.

**!!!!! WARNING !!!!!**
Starting with 5.1.x all backwards compatibiltiy with prior 4.x style configuration options has been removed.  Upgrades from 4.x versions are still possible but will require manual conversion of any legacy configuration methods and options.  Upgrades from 5.0.x versions should not require any changes.

**New Features**
- Added ability to refine event stream to only motion events where a person is detected
- Option to select transcoded vs raw video for event stream (this also changes the URL for scripting automatic download of recordings):
  - Raw video (default) - This video is exactly as it was recorded by the camera and is the same as previous versions of ring-mqtt
  - Transcoded video - This is the same as selecting to share/download video from the Ring app or web dashboard.  This video includes the Ring logo and timestamps and may include supplemental pre-roll video for supported devices.  Note that switching from a raw to transcoded event selection can take 10-15 seconds as transcoded videos are created by Ring on-demand so ring-mqtt must wait for the Ring servers to process the video and return the URL.
- New camera models should now display with correct model/features
- Improved support for cameras with dual batteries.  The BatteryLevel attribute always reports the level of currently active battery but the level of both batteries is individually available via the batteryLife and batteryLife2 attributes.
- Switch to enable/disable the Chime Pro nightlight.  The current nightlight on/off state can be determined via attribute.

**Other Changes**
- Reduced average live stream startup time by several hundred milliseconds with the following changes:
  - Switched from rtsp-simple-server to go2rtc as the core streaming engine which provides slightly faster stream startup and opens the door for future feature enhancements.  This switch is expected to be transparent for users, but please report any issues.
  - Cameras now allocate a dedicated worker thread for live streaming vs previous versions which used a pool of worker threads based on the number of processor cores detected.  This simplifies the live stream code and leads to faster stream startup and, hopefully, more reliable recovery from various error conditions.
  - The recommended configuration for streaming setup in Home Assistant is now to use the go2rtc addon with RTSPtoWebRTC integration.  This provides fast stream startup and shutdown and low-latency live vieweing (typically <1 second latency).

**Dependency Updates**
- Replaced problematic colors package with chalk for colorizing debug log output
- Bump ring-client-api to 11.7.1 (various fixes and support for newer cameras)
- Bump other dependent packages to latest versions
- Migrated project codebase from CommonJS to ESM.  As this project is not a library this should have zero impact for users, but it does ease ongoing maintenance by enabling the ability to pull in newer versions of various dependent packages that have also moved to pure ESM.

### Changes prior to v5.1.0 are tracked in the [historical changelog](https://github.com/tsightler/ring-mqtt/blob/main/docs/CHANGELOG-HIST.md)
